MathJax allows you to include mathematics in your web pages, either using LaTeX,
MathML, or AsciiMath notation, and the mathematics will be processed using
JavaScript to produce HTML, SVG or MathML equations for viewing in any modern browser.

For simplicity, this post will only cover how MathJax works with LaTeX.

There are two ways to access MathJax:
- Use the copy of MathJax available from a distributed network service such as `cdnjs.com` (Recommended)
- Download and install a copy of MathJax on your own server, or use it locally on your hard disk.
